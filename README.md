<em>Homework for lesson eight</em>

Create a program to simulate the work of a clinic. 
Let there be three doctors in the clinic: <code>surgeon</code>, <code>therapist</code>, <code>dentist</code>.
Each doctor has a <code>"treat"</code> method, but each doctor treats differently. 
Also provide a class <code>"Patient"</code> with a field <code>"Treatment plan"</code> and a field <code>"Doctor"</code>.
Create an object of the <code>"Patient"</code> class and add a treatment plan to the patient. 
Create a method for the therapist to <code>assign a doctor</code> to the patient according to the treatment plan.

<em>treatment plan:</em>
- If the treatment plan has code <code>1</code> - assign a surgeon and execute the treat method.
- If the treatment plan has code <code>2</code> - assign a dentist and execute the treat method.
- If the treatment plan has any other code - assign a therapist and perform method
treat.
